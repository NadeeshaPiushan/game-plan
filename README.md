# Soccer Tactic Board Made with the Help of Gemini(Goodle) and ChatGPT(OpenAI) LLMs

Ever since I had the idea of creating something for sports using technology back in university while studying Sports Science, I wanted to build this project. However, my lack of coding knowledge held me back. After learning the basics of web development and with the support of Large Language Models (LLMs), I was able to create a foundational version of this project. 

The exciting potential of AI-assisted development is that if someone with limited programming experience can achieve this with React, imagine what skilled programmers could accomplish!
